## Project Specs
- Language: Javascript, HTML
- Responsiblilites: Art and design direction (100%), story direction (60%), coding implementation (25%)
- Grade: 110%/100%
- Instructor comment: Amazing details - adding sound and things like dust particles was amazing! Also, creating all the art by hand was extremely impressive. Everything came together very very nicely and was very cohesive - impressive interactions / collision detections. Absolutely excellent.
- Completed Dec 6 2021

## Project Instructions from Professor
Your final project for CPE 123 is a team project (group sizes 3-5).  In general, your final project should be an interactive sketch, game, or animated short.  This project is intended to be the culmination of your work this quarter, so please be creative, expressive and include all the relevant technologies we have learned. 

As with all grading this quarter 75% of your grade will be for technical complexity and 25% will be for artistic aesthetic qualities in the story/interactive program.

**Required Technologies**
- Animation (something is moving)
- Human Interaction (via mouse clicking or key pressing)
- Use of Arrays
- Use of Functions
- Hierarchical Modeling (characters with joints or parts that move)

**Suggested Technologies (Not required, but just to give you some ideas…)**
- Use of Implicit Equations (for location detection of drawing or click detection)
- Creating a “painting” effect like the impressionism lab.
- Use of  Movement (velocity / acceleration)
